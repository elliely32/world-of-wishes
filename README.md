# World of Wishes

World of Wishes is an interactive website where users can ‘make a wish’ and see their wish adorned to a sky full of wishes. It consists of a database with user input data, admin filtration, and data visualization of database information. This project was created during a stack-a-thon that took place over 4 days.
